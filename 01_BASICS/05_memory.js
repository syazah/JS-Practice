//STACK (Primitive Datatypes)
/* It is call by value so whenever we call this variable or use this variable then a copy of that variable is made.*/


//Heap (Non Primitive data types)
/* It is call by reference, so whenever we use this variable a pointer is pointed towards this variable thus a reference is obtained hence actual changes are observed  */
