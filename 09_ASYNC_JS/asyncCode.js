/* JAVASCRIPT IS A 
SYNCHRONOUS (Executes the code line by line)
SINGLE THREADED LANGUAGE (Only a single thread is present) 
This is the default behaviour of JAVASCRIPT
*/

/* TYPES OF CODE IN JS:- 
    BLOCKING CODE :- BLOCKS THE FLOW OF THE PROGRAM (READ FILE SYNC)
    NON BLOCKING CODE :- DOES NOT BLOCKS THE CODE EXECUTION (READ FILE ASYNC) 
*/

/* setTimeout() and setInterval() are examples of async js (rest codes are executed and some codes are executed in the background simultaneously) These are not the part of core javascript, we get the access of these through event queue in the window*/
